WP-Sweep allows you to clean up unused, orphaned and duplicated data in your WordPress. It also optimizes your database tables.

## Description
This plugin cleans up: 

* Revisions
* Auto drafts
* Deleted comments
* Unapproved comments

* wp_delete_post()
* wp_delete_comment()
* delete_post_meta()
* delete_comment_meta()
* delete_user_meta()
